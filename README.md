Library for solutions

It is a script written in python language that collects my solution recipes and protocols that I use in my experiments. 
It also contains separate codes for calculating "Concentration" and "Molarity". 
This software will be updated regularly, allowing solution recipes and protocols written in different places to be collected together.

- Run the code by typing "python3 Final.py" into the terminal.
-Select which solution recipe or protocol you want to see from the list.
-Check the end of the list if you want to calculate "Molarity" or "Concentration" to prepare a recipe.
